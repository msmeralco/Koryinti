## Contributing

We follow a structured Git workflow for collaboration:

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production code
- `develop` - Integration branch
- `feature/*` - New features
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes

### Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# 2. Make changes and test
npm start

# 3. Run quality checks
npm run lint
npm run type-check

# 4. Commit with convention
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# 5. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/my-feature
````

**See [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed guidelines.**

## Security

### Environment Variables

All sensitive data stored in `.env` (never committed):

```env
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_key
API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxx
```

### Security Features

- Environment-based configuration
- `.env` in `.gitignore`
- Automated security audits in CI/CD
- No hardcoded secrets
- Secret scanning with TruffleHog

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

Every push and PR automatically runs:

- ESLint code quality checks
- TypeScript type validation
- Prettier formatting verification
- npm security audit
- Expo configuration check
- Secret scanning

**Pipeline must pass before merging.**

## Development Scripts

```bash
npx expo start --tunnel          # Start Expo dev server
npm run android    # Run on Android
npm run ios        # Run on iOS
npm run lint       # Check code quality
npm run lint:fix   # Auto-fix issues
npm run format     # Format code
npm run type-check # TypeScript validation
```

---

## Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
- **Components**: Functional components with hooks
- **Documentation**: Docstrings for major functions
- **Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions
- **No comments**: Prefer self-documenting code and docstrings

Example:

```typescript
/**
 * StationProfileScreen displays detailed information about a charging station
 * including address, amenities, pricing, and available actions.
 */
export default function StationProfileScreen({ navigation, route }: Props) {
  // Implementation
}
```
